# Guru

A computational knowledge client for C-Net/5 Amiga BBS written in ARexx and powered by Wolfram|Alpha


Guru can be used from the C-Net command line as a global command:
![guruJayMiner](https://github.com/mkillewald/Guru/blob/master/screenshots/guruJayMiner.png)

or as a custom noise in C-Net Conference with two different response modes: Possession and Direct

In Possession mode, Guru responds through the user themselves:
